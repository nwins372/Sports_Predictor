# Statistics Page - Complete Implementation Summary

## What Was Done

I've successfully transformed the Sports.jsx page into a Statistics.jsx page with full support for NBA, NFL, and MLB teams, including weekly data updates.

## ✅ Features Implemented

### 1. **Statistics Page** (`src/pages/Statistics.jsx`)
- Displays user's favorite teams from their profile preferences
- Shows team records (wins, losses, ties)
- Expandable team cards that show:
  - Team statistics (points, rebounds, ERA, etc.)
  - Current roster with up to 20 players
  - Player information (name, jersey number, position)
  - Player statistics
  - Player headshots

### 2. **MLB Support Added**
- Added all 30 MLB teams to the system
- Created MLB team mappings in Statistics.jsx
- Updated espnApi.js to support MLB endpoints
- Fetched current MLB data (✅ completed)

### 3. **Weekly Update System**

#### Automated Updates via GitHub Actions
- Created `.github/workflows/weekly-team-stats-update.yml`
- Runs automatically every Sunday at midnight UTC
- Updates NBA, NFL, and MLB team data
- Commits changes automatically

#### Manual Update Commands
```bash
# Update all leagues
npm run update-stats

# Update specific leagues
npm run update-nba
npm run update-nfl
npm run update-mlb
```

### 4. **Documentation Created**
- `scripts/README_WEEKLY_UPDATES.md` - Detailed weekly update guide
- `scripts/QUICK_START.md` - Quick start guide for updates
- This summary document

## 📊 Current Data Status

### ✅ NFL - AVAILABLE

### ✅ MLB - UPDATED

## 🎯 How It Works

### User Experience
1. User selects favorite teams in their Profile
2. Goes to Statistics page
3. Sees all favorite teams grouped by sport
4. Clicks on a team to expand and see:
   - Team statistics
   - Full roster with player stats
   - Player photos and details

### Data Flow
1. **Profile Selection**: User picks teams in Profile.jsx
2. **Storage**: Teams saved to Supabase `user_preferences` table
3. **Fetch**: Statistics page loads team data from local JSON files
4. **Display**: Teams shown with current stats and rosters
5. **Updates**: Weekly script refreshes all data from ESPN API

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Data not available" message
- **Cause**: Team JSON file doesn't exist or mapping is incorrect
- **Solution**: Run `npm run update-nba` (or nfl/mlb) to fetch data

### Teams don't expand when clicked
- **Cause**: JavaScript error or missing data
- **Solution**: Check browser console for errors, verify JSON files exist

### Outdated statistics
- **Cause**: Data hasn't been updated recently
- **Solution**: Run the update script manually or wait for weekly update

## 📈 Data Structure

Each team JSON file contains:
```json
{
  "fetchedAt": "2024-01-15T00:00:00.000Z",
  "detail": {
    "team": {
      "id": "1",
      "displayName": "Boston Celtics",
      "record": { "items": [{ "stats": [...] }] },
      "logos": [...]
    }
  },
  "roster": { "entries": [...] },
  "injuries": [...]
}
```

## 🎨 Styling

The Statistics page uses:
- Dark theme with accent colors
- Responsive grid layouts
- Smooth animations for expanding teams
- Hover effects on cards
- Mobile-friendly design

## 📝 Next Steps
